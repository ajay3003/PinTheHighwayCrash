### 🚨 PinTheHighwayCrash — A Field-Ready Emergency Location App

After months of design, testing, and optimization, I’m proud to share **PinTheHighwayCrash** — a **Blazor WebAssembly Progressive Web App (PWA)** built for **emergency response in low-connectivity areas**.

---

#### 🧭 What It Does

When someone encounters a highway accident, they can:

- **Pin their exact location** on a map (GPS or manually pasted link)
- **Verify** the spot is actually on a road (using OpenStreetMap/Nominatim)
- **Send alerts instantly** via call, SMS, email, or WhatsApp — all prefilled with emergency details
- And if there’s **no internet or poor signal**, the app still runs fully offline with cached maps and stored config.

---

#### ⚙️ How It Works

- **Offline-first architecture:** Custom service worker caches the full app shell and OpenStreetMap tiles.
- **Config-driven behavior:** All numbers, templates, and feature flags live in `appsettings.json` — easy to adapt for any region.
- **Smart geolocation fallback:** If GPS fails, users can paste coordinates, Plus Codes, or Maps links.
- **Zero backend dependency:** Everything runs client-side in the browser — no servers, no APIs.

---

#### 🌍 Why It Matters

In real-world emergencies, **network connectivity can’t be assumed**.  
This project bridges that gap — turning any smartphone into a quick-response locator even in offline or rural conditions.

---

#### 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Blazor WebAssembly (.NET 8)**
- **Leaflet.js** for mapping
- **Service Worker + PWA manifest** for offline mode
- **OpenStreetMap + Nominatim APIs**
- **Bootstrap 5 / Icons** for UI

---

#### 💡 Highlights

- ✅ Configurable and reusable (region-neutral)  
- ✅ Works fully offline  
- ✅ Typed options with clean DI pattern  
- ✅ Map caching and verification  
- ✅ Easy to deploy on GitHub Pages or any static host

---

#### 🔗 Live Deployment Ready

The app is optimized for **static hosting** (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Azure Static Web Apps).  
It’s installable on mobile and desktop as a **PWA**.

---

#### ❤️ Final Thought

This wasn’t just about code — it was about **designing for reliability when it matters most**.  
Building something that could literally help someone find help faster — that’s what makes tech meaningful.

## 🌐 Offline Mode — What Works and What Doesn’t

Your app’s **offline capability** is about *running without depending on the internet to load or function locally*.  
That’s different from being able to *send messages through the network* (which still requires a signal or data connection).

### ✅ What Still Works Offline (Fully Functional)

Handled **entirely by the browser and OS**, no network needed:

1. **App Launches Instantly**  
   Service Worker caches all files (HTML, JS, CSS, icons, Leaflet map tiles).

2. **Map Viewing (Cached Areas)**  
   OpenStreetMap tiles you’ve already viewed are stored locally.

3. **GPS / Manual Input**  
   Geolocation (GPS chip) still works without internet. You can also paste coordinates.

4. **UI Logic & Verification Rules**  
   Distance, accuracy, and validation logic run client-side in C# WebAssembly.

5. **Phone & SMS Actions**  
   `tel:` and `sms:` links open the device’s dialer/messaging app, which can work via the **cellular network** without internet.

### 🚫 What Requires Internet/Data Connection

1. **Reverse/Forward Geocoding (Nominatim)** — needs network.  
2. **WhatsApp Links (`wa.me/...`)** — opens app, but sending needs data.  
3. **Email (mailto:)** — opens mail client, but sending needs data.  
4. **New Map Tiles** — uncached areas won’t render until online.

### ⚙️ How It Degrades Gracefully

- Offline badge warns users: “You are offline. Map tiles and verification may be limited.”  
- **Call** and **SMS** work immediately.  
- WhatsApp and Email buttons open, but messages send when connectivity is back.  
- App remains usable — no “white screen” or hard error.

|-------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| App startup             | ✅              | Served from service worker cache |
| Map (cached area)       | ✅              | Tiles stored locally             |
| GPS                     | ✅              | Uses device hardware             |
| Paste / Pin location    | ✅              | Runs fully in the browser        |
| Reverse/Forward geocode | ❌              | Needs OSM API/network            |
| Call (112 etc.)         | ✅              | Uses phone network               |
| SMS alert               | ✅              | Uses carrier signal              |
| WhatsApp                | ⚠️             | Opens app; needs data to send    |
| Email                   | ⚠️             | Opens mail; needs data to send   |
